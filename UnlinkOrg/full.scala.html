  Hi @orgAdminFirstName,<br />
  <br />
  Your account for @orgName has been unlinked from the @cityName network, which means your published content will no longer be available to youth through the @cityName landing page.<br />
  <br />
  If you have any questions regarding this change, please get in touch with your contact at @anchorOrgName .<br />
  <br />
  Best Regards,<br />
