    Hello @firstName,<br />
    <br />
    The account request you submitted for your organization has been declined by LRNG. Often, account requests are declined because they are redundant with existing accounts or because your organization should, instead, request a direct invitation from your network lead. Regardless, if you believe you were declined in error or need additional support, please contact us at <a href="mailto:@supportEmail">@supportEmail</a>.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Best,<br />
    The LRNG Team
