    Hi @displayName,

    Almost there! Your work for the "@playlistName" Playlist has been reviewed by @orgName, and it looks like revisions are needed in order to earn the "@badgeName" Badge on LRNG.

    All you need to do is check out the feedback, update your XPs, and re-submit for approval.

    Visit LRNG to view feedback.

    Best Regards,
    The LRNG Team
